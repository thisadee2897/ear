The dataset includes 1200 images.
Ear are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)
* Grayscale (CRT phosphor)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 4.2 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1.76 percent of pixels
